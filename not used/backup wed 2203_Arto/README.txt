Templates for students
----------------------

Every directory in this project contains a MATLAB/Simulink template model for a
specific setup and other files required to run the model. Of course the models
don't include a controller, therefore they can't be used for demonstrations.
Complete demonstrations are available in the "Demonstrations" project.

This project should be cloned to c:\Opstellingen (Windows 10) or d:\Opstellingen
(Windows 7).
